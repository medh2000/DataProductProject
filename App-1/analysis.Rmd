This report perform an regresllion analysuis on mtcars dataset. It look to predict Miles Per gallon (mpg) based on weight of a car.

What can we infer from the weigh of a car and how much that it affects the miles per gallon run amomg other variables like the numbe of cylinders.

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
