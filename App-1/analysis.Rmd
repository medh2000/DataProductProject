Description:
------------
This short study describes the effect of a car weight on miles per gallon consummed. How a car weight might affect MPG. Other factors may affect also MPG such as the number of cylinders, horse power , etc. We also create a linear regression to depict the relationship between weight and MPG and draw a regression graph.
This report perform an regression analysis on mtcars dataset. It looks to predict Miles Per gallon (mpg) based on weight of a car.

What can we infer from the weigh of a car and how much that it affects the miles per gallon used amomg other variables like the number of cylinders.


Usage:
------
1- User enter a car weight

2- Weight is displayed in either Tons or Pounds

3- A regression equation is used to calculate the weight of the car based on MPG
